## 🌱 Background

Cornell CS graduate with interdisciplinary experience across computer science, computational genomics, and mission-driven research. I've conducted international fieldwork in Ecuador, Cambodia, and Mexico, and worked at PwC, NAIC, and multiple research institutions. Beyond code, I'm a documentary filmmaker, muralist, and D1 athlete.

**What drives me:** Technology should serve the collective, not just maximize profit. My work bridges technical implementation with social impact—from healthcare equity to financial inclusion to policy-informed data science.
