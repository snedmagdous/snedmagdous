# Hi, I'm Maya Murry 👋

**Full-Stack Developer | Cornell CS '25 | Building Technology for Social Impact**

I'm a software engineer passionate about using technology to dismantle systemic inequities. Currently leading full-stack development at [PainTrust Technologies](https://paintrust.com), where I'm building AI-powered healthcare solutions that address gender and racial bias in pain assessment and treatment.

## 🔭 What I Do

I build full-stack applications with React/TypeScript frontends and Node.js backends, integrating AI/ML capabilities to solve real-world problems in healthcare, finance, and social justice. My interdisciplinary background spans computer science, computational genomics, and data-driven research—enabling me to bridge technical implementation with mission-driven impact.

**Current Focus:**
- 🏥 Leading product development for AI-powered diagnostic tools at PainTrust Technologies
- 🔬 Leveraging computational approaches to understand algorithmic bias and systemic inequities
- 📊 Building data science projects that inform policy and drive social change

## 💻 Technical Stack

**Languages:** Python (8 years) | TypeScript/JavaScript | R | SQL | HTML/CSS | C/Java

**Frontend:** React | React Native | React Hooks | GraphQL | Angular

**Backend:** Node.js | Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI) | RESTful APIs

**AI/ML:** Azure OpenAI | LangChain | TensorFlow | PyTorch | NLP

**Data Science:** Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Statistical Modeling | Data Visualization

**Tools & Platforms:** Git | Docker | AWS | MongoDB | PostgreSQL | MySQL

## 🌱 Featured Work

### Healthcare Technology
- **AI-Powered Diagnostic Platform** - Lead developer building real-time pain assessment tools using React/TypeScript, enabling objective medical evaluations through computer vision and machine learning

### Data Science & Research
- **Computational Genomics** - Developed pipelines analyzing 10K+ complex datasets using Python, GraphQL, and statistical modeling for epigenetic trauma research
- **Algorithmic Bias Research** - Co-authored research on privacy-preserving AI systems and facial recognition bias, achieving 92% effectiveness in protecting user identity

### Enterprise Applications
- **Healthcare Compliance Automation** - Built AI-powered semantic search systems using React, LangChain, and Azure OpenAI, reducing manual processes by 25% for insurance companies

## 🎯 What Drives Me

I believe technology should serve the collective, not just maximize profit. My work sits at the intersection of:
- **Social Justice** - Using data science and AI to expose and address systemic inequities
- **Healthcare Equity** - Building tools that ensure patients receive unbiased, quality care
- **Financial Inclusion** - Creating systems that increase capital access for underrepresented founders

Beyond code, I'm a documentary filmmaker, muralist, and D1 athlete (Cornell Women's Wrestling). I've conducted international research in Ecuador, Cambodia, and Mexico, and I'm committed to building technology that reflects diverse perspectives and lived experiences.
